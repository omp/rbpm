rbpm (ruby path mangler)

https://github.com/omp/rbpm
Manage multiple Ruby installations with no black magic.


NOTES

  rbpm only manages rubies located in the ~/.rubies directory. This behaviour
  can be changed by setting the RUBIES_PATH environment variable to some other
  location. rbpm does not display information about rubies it does not manage,
  such as any system-wide install.

  rbpm performs a substring match when selecting a ruby, using the highest
  matching directory when there are multiple matches.


DEPENDENCIES

  bash (>= 4.0)
  coreutils (sort)
  findutils (xargs)


INSTALLING

  Save the script to a safe location, then add the following function to your
  ~/.bashrc or equivalent file:

      rbpm() { source <(/path/to/rbpm.sh "${@}"); }


INSTALLING RUBIES

  The path to the executable should look something like this:

      ~/.rubies/ruby-2.1.2/bin/ruby

  To install Ruby to this directory:

      $ wget http://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.1/ruby-2.1.2.tar.bz2
      $ tar -xf ruby-2.1.2.tar.bz2
      $ cd ruby-2.1.2
      $ ./configure --prefix="${HOME}"/.rubies/ruby-2.1.2
      $ make
      $ make install


USAGE

  A sequence of commands showing rbpm in use:

      $ rbpm ls
        ruby-1.8.7-p374
        ruby-1.9.3-p547
        ruby-2.1.2

      $ rbpm set 2.1
      Adding /home/omp/.rubies/ruby-2.1.2/bin to PATH.

      $ rbpm ls
        ruby-1.8.7-p374
        ruby-1.9.3-p547
      * ruby-2.1.2

      $ ruby -v
      ruby 2.1.2p95 (2014-05-08 revision 45877) [x86_64-linux]

      $ rbpm set 1.9
      Removing /home/omp/.rubies/ruby-2.1.2/bin from PATH.
      Adding /home/omp/.rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p547/bin to PATH.

      $ ruby -v
      ruby 1.9.3p547 (2014-05-14 revision 45962) [x86_64-linux]

      $ rbpm clear
      Removing /home/omp/.rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p547/bin from PATH.

  To set the version from a .ruby-version file:

      $ rbpm set $(cat .ruby-version)
      Adding /home/omp/.rubies/ruby-1.8.7-p374/bin to PATH.
